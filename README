name: Ron Krakovsky

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Changes - 
* the defconfig for this board in /configs/terasic_de10nano_cyclone5_defconfig
* Device Tree in /board_de10nano_dts/socfpga_cyclone5_de10_nano.dts
* genimage for SDcard in folder board/terasic/de10nano_cyclone5/genimage.cfg

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create Image ,follow this steps -
1) git clone this project to your computer.
2) run 'make terasic_de10nano_cyclone5_defconfig' (this defconfig have the base for run image and more things that I add, like QT5)
3) run 'make menuconfig' (change things you want add ot change for your project image)
** if you want save your changes in configs run 'make savedefconfig' (it will save it in configs files by name terasic_de10nano_cyclone5_defconfig)
4) run 'make' (to generate image and sdcard, becuase I add genimage in board de10_nano it create itself sdcard)
5) wait while it compiles and all files will save in output files.

Copy SDcard.imag in sdcard ,follow this steps -
1) run 'lsblk' (find your sdcard name)
2) run 'sudo umount sdb' (to check if nothing mount to your sdcard, (sdb is my name if sdcard))
3) run 'sudo dd if=sdcard.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1M status=progress' (to copy in sdcard the files image)
4) wait 1 minute after run last command although it show that it finished.
5) run 'sync' 
6) run 'sudo eject /dev/sdb'

Run your image on the board ,Follow this steps - 
1) make sure your sdcard connected to board and the SWITCH CONFIGS on the board in the right place.
for example, in DE10_NANO all switch ON.
2) conect USB to your computer and if its your first time install picocom for UART Commuinication with HPS.
run 'sudo apt install -y picocom'
3) create USER for picocom run 'sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER' for check run 'groups $USER'
4) run 'picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0' for run UART with hps
5) enter login for your Linux image ; user = root / password = 123456
if you dont have nothing do coldreset button
